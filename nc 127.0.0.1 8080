### Username Requirements

When connecting, clients must provide a valid username that follows these rules:
- Must be between 3 and 20 characters long
- Can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens
- Cannot start or end with a hyphen
- Cannot contain double hyphens (--)
- Must be unique among connected clients

### Usage

1. Start the server with one of the methods above
2. Connect with a telnet client
3. Enter a valid username when prompted
4. Start chatting! Messages will be broadcast to all connected clients
5. Press Ctrl+C to gracefully shut down the server

## Implementation Details

This project demonstrates several important C# concepts:
- Asynchronous programming with `async`/`await`
- Concurrent collections for thread-safe operations
- TCP socket programming
- CancellationToken usage for graceful shutdowns
- Regular expressions for input validation
- Proper resource disposal with `using` statements
